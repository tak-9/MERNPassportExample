#### Create MySQL Database 
Execute the following command or run `db/create_database.sql` to create a new database in MySQL.

```
mysql> CREATE DATABASE mern_passport;
```

#### Setting Environment for MySQL Database 

`.env` file is for setting environment variables. `.env_sample` is template for `.env` file. 
This `.env` file has not uploaded to GitHub as it is listed in `.gitignore` file.
Copy template file `.env_sample` to `.env` file and used it in your local environment. 

```
$ cp .env_sample .env
```

Modify this file according to your MySQL environment. (Username, Password and Hostname)

```
NODE_ENV=development
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=password
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_DATABASE=mern_passport
```
Your password is kept private in your host (not uploaded to GitHub) as `.env` is in `.gitignore`. This is convenient when working in a team too. We don't have conflict in mergining password file.

$ npm start 
```
